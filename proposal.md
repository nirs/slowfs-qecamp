How do you debug a customer issue when deleting a file on the customer
server takes 90 seconds? In your lab, deleting a file takes no time, and
you cannot reproduce the issue. You need slow storage to reproduce the
customer issue fast! Nir will demonstrate SlowFS, a configurable and
extensible file system that can simulate overloaded storage.

The talk is targeted at storage quality engineers. The audience may find
SlowFS useful for their work or learn how to use FUSE and python to
implement similar testing tools.

SlowFS is free software hosted in github:
